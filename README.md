# Cifar-10 Similarity Analysis
Siamese Network trained with Keras using SqueezeNet embedded features with Contrastive Loss to find similar images in CIFAR-10 Dataset

After Navigating to the project root folder run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To make a detection unzip the data_test.zip file to extract test data and run:
`python script.py --image_path <image-path> --data_path <data-path>`
or
`python script.py -i <image-path> -d <data-path>`

For training open the CIFAR10-Similarity-Analysis Jupyter notebook and run cells step by step.
